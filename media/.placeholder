# Media Directory

This directory contains all media files for the Morrowind Alchemy Compendium project. It includes subdirectories for storing images related to ingredients, effects, and vendors.

## Subdirectories:
- `effect_icons/`: Stores icons for alchemy effects.
- `ingredient_images/`: Stores images of ingredients.
- `vendor_images/`: Stores images of vendors.

## Notes:
- These directories are required for the application to function correctly.
- The actual media files are not tracked by version control to reduce repository size. Placeholder files (`.placeholder`) are used to retain the folder structure.
